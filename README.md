# CMartinezReverseIt-7
// Chris Martinez
 I was able to add validation on this project, as I've done to the other 8 program. Nothing else really enhanced besides validation at this time.

 The program accepts my input of a series of numbers and flips it, displaying my input in reverse order. It functions properly and allows me to reverse the numbers I input, and it also prompts me to correct my input if it is not an integer. Good job !
